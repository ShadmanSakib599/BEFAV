# BEFAV – Motor Mount Assembly

**For full details, refer to the PDF report included in this repository.**

This repository contains the CAD models and technical drawing for a motor mount assembly designed for **BEFAV (Bio-Inspired Environmentally Friendly Aerial Vehicle)** – a conceptual VTOL/eVTOL-style aerial vehicle. The mount is intended to securely support an electric propulsion unit while minimizing weight and maintaining sufficient stiffness and strength.

The repository showcases the design progression from an initial solid/truss concept to a **topology-optimized** motor mount suitable for lightweight aerial vehicle applications.

## Project Overview

The motor mount serves as the structural interface between the propulsion system and the aircraft frame. It is designed to:

- Carry **thrust, torque, and bending loads** from the electric motor/propeller.
- Interface with an airframe rib, pylon, or nacelle structure.
- Minimize structural mass while maintaining stiffness and strength.
- Support manufacturability through machining or additive manufacturing.

This component contributes to the broader BEFAV concept, which focuses on efficient, electrically powered, environmentally conscious aerial vehicle design.

## Design Goals & Constraints

The motor mount was developed under the following considerations:

### **Loads**
- Axial thrust generated by the motor/propeller.
- Torque from the motor’s rotational output.
- Bending stresses due to aerodynamic and inertial loads.

### **Performance Targets**
- Reduce mass while maintaining stiffness.
- Keep stress below allowable material limits.
- Ensure tight control of deflection at the motor interface.

### **Interface Requirements**
- Bolt pattern compatible with common electric motors.
- Wall thicknesses and rib structures tuned for strength.
- Clearances for wiring and motor geometry.

### **Manufacturability**
- Geometry feasible for CNC machining.
- Alternative option for metal or reinforced polymer additive manufacturing.
- Fillets and smooth transitions to reduce stress concentrations.

## Design & Optimization Workflow

### **1. Baseline Geometry**
A solid baseline model was developed to establish load paths, mounting surfaces, and overall packaging.

### **2. Truss-Style Refinement**
The baseline was converted into a truss-inspired configuration to:
- Concentrate material along high-stress paths.
- Reduce non-critical material.
- Improve stiffness-to-weight ratio.

### **3. Topology Optimization**
The design was further optimized by:
- Removing material in low-stress regions.
- Preserving key interfaces and boundary constraints.
- Producing a light, efficient structure ready for FEA validation.

### **4. Intended Validation**
The optimized geometry can be assessed using FEA to check:
- Von Mises stress distribution.
- Deflection at the motor face.
- Safety factors based on chosen materials.

## Using the Models

### **Viewing & Editing**
Open the **STEP** files in:
- SolidWorks  
- Autodesk Fusion 360 / Inventor  
- CATIA  
- Siemens NX  
- FreeCAD  

Open the **STL** files for:
- 3D printing  
- Mesh visualization  
- Mesh-based FEA  

### **Integration into a Project**
1. Import the STEP file into your CAD environment.  
2. Align it using the bolt pattern or mounting face.  
3. Adapt hole sizes, clearances, or wall thicknesses as needed.  
4. Perform FEA using your own load cases and material selections.
